################################################################################
# Docstrings
################################################################################

# Python offers the option for a description at the beginning of each file,
# function or class which is called "docstring" and is enclosed in three double
# quotes. What you can see above is such a docstring. Docstrings are for
# documentation purposes and are not executed as Python code, i.e., they don't
# do anything.

# The content in docstrings can range from short notes to extensive
# documentation with input/output arguments etc. It will automatically be parsed
# (if possible) and displayed in the help for the specific function or class. In
# PyCharm, you can toggle this help by left-clicking on a function or class and
# pressing Ctrl+q or selecting "Quick Documentation" in the "View" menu bar.

# There are different conventions/styles on how to write docstrings. If you are
# working on an existing project, make sure to use the same style. If you set up
# your own project, choose any style you want and then stay consistent. The
# general conventions for docstrings can be found here:
# https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/


################################################################################
# Comments
################################################################################

# Comments are part of a Python file that are not executed, i.e., they don't do
# anything. Comments in Python start with a hashtag (#). You can also place
# comments after non-comment statements using a hashtag. Since this line starts
# with a character, it is a comment.

# There are conventions and advices regarding code style in Python, such as
# https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. It will help you a lot to keep your
# code readable and clean, however, Python does not explicitly force you to
# follow it. We will stick to this style as good as possible in this lecture.
# PyCharm tries to highlight code that goes against PEP standards.

# Python program code is stored in text files. The standard filename suffix
# indicating a Python file is ".py", e.g., "my_file.py".

# A Python code file is executed line by line (from top to bottom of the file).
# Python evaluates expressions from left to right, but when evaluating an
# assignment, the right-hand side is evaluated before the left-hand side.

################################################################################
# Variables
################################################################################

#
# General
#

# Variables in Python are just references to objects stored and generated
# automatically in the background, i.e., they are essentially only names or
# identifiers that reference objects - they themselves do not store any
# information. Variable names must start with characters that are not digits and
# not operators. Python variables are case-sensitive. Use all lowercase names
# with underscores for variables.

# In the next line, a variable "var" is created that points to a string object
# with content "hello, world!", which is created and stored somewhere in the
# background. This is done via the assignment operator "=", where the variable
# name is on the left and the content to assign is on the right side of the
# equal sign.
var = "hello, world!"

# We can change the type and content of a variable at any time, since the
# variable is just a reference to some object stored in the background. We can,
# e.g., let it point to the integer object 5 now:
var = 5

# You can remove a variable with the del statement, but the storage/memory it
# points to will only be freed some time after no more variables are pointing
# there. This happens automatically via the "garbage collector" that removes
# objects from memory that are no no longer referenced by anything (garbage).
del var

#
# Error messages
#

# Variable names must not start with digits. Try to run this line in your Python
# console without the hashtag:
# 1var = 5
# You will see that you receive an error message (SyntaxError). Such error
# messages can help you a lot to find out what went wrong. Try to get familiar
# with reading and using them.

#
# Memory usage
#

# A variable pointing to an object takes up 16+x bytes (in native Python) for a
# 64bit Python3 installation. This results from:
# (type pointer (8 bytes) + refcount (8 bytes) + object bytes (x bytes))
# = 16+x bytes
# So we pay for convenient code by inefficient memory usage because we have a
# 16 bytes overhead for every (CPython) object, in addition to the x bytes it
# takes to store the object itself. However, you can write memory efficient code
# in Python if you use one of the many Python packages we will see later.


################################################################################
# Data types (1)
################################################################################

#
# Booleans ("bool")
#

# Booleans can take the values True or False. They are used for binary
# information, like checking whether a condition is fulfilled or not.

# Here, we create a boolean variable with content True
true_variable = True
# Here, we create another boolean variable with content False
false_variable = False

# The "not" keyword can be used to negate a boolean
another_true_variable = not false_variable

# Booleans in native Python3 are stored like integers (see below), where
# True has the value 1 and False has the value 0.

#
# Integer numbers ("int")
#

# Integer numbers can be created using digits.

# Here, we create a variable that points to an integer object 5.
an_integer = 5

# Integers in native Python3 are variable-length objects. This means that you do
# not have to worry about overflow problems with integers with large values. In
# practice, a base integer using 4 bytes (=32bits) is stored with an additional
# 8 bytes counter. One integer can use multiple base integer memories and the
# counter counts how many base integer memories are used. For an integer, Python
# would use 12 bytes and allocate more memory as needed. Combined with the
# 16 bytes overhead, this results in 28 bytes. The integer 0 is an exception
# that only uses the 8 bytes counter and no 4 bytes base memory.
# Note: This allocation scheme will not be important for us. All that matters is
# that we do not have to worry about overflow problems and that we are aware
# that our memory usage might be inefficient.

#
# Floating point numbers ("float")
#

# Floating point numbers can be created using digits combined with a dot.

# Here, we create a variable that points to a float object with value 3.563
a_float = 3.563

# Alternatively, we can use the character "e" between digits to indicate decimal
# powers for float numbers. Syntax: multiplier e decimal_power
another_float = 2e1  # Corresponds to 2 * 10^1 = 20.0
yet_another_float = 1e-3  # Corresponds to 1 * 10^-3 = 0.001

# Floating point numbers in native Python3 are stored as 8 bytes float (=64bits
# float). For storing a CPython float, Python3 would use 8 bytes. Combined with
# the 16 bytes overhead, this results in 24 bytes in total. Keep in mind that
# floating point values are stored with a fixed number of bits and therefore can
# lose precision.

#
# Making numbers more readable
#

# One can use underscore characters in numbers for readability:
large_int = 123_456_789
large_float = 123_456_789.123_456_789


################################################################################
# Mathematical operations
################################################################################

# Python supports all sorts of mathematical operations using the operators
# + for addition
# - for subtraction
# * for multiplication
# / for division
# ** for power of (syntax: a ** b corresponds to "a" to the power of "b")
# % modulo operation (get the remainder of a division)
# // get the floor value of a division (integer division)

# Addition of ints produces an int
sum_integer = an_integer + an_integer

# Addition of floats produces a float
sum_float = a_float + a_float

# Combining ints and floats produces a float
combination = an_integer + a_float

# Mathematical operations can be combined arbitrarily (common rules for order of
# mathematical operations, including parentheses, apply)
combination = ((an_integer + a_float * an_integer) / a_float) ** 5

# You can use the syntax shortcuts +=, -=, etc. if you want to modify a variable
combination += 4  # Identical to: combination = combination + 4
combination /= 2.5
combination **= 2

# If you combine boolean and other numbers, True will be 1 and False will be 0
combination -= True

# You can break long statements into multiple lines with a backslash "\"
combination += 4 + 6 - \
    3 + 5
# Or you can just put them into parentheses and have linebreaks
combination -= (1 + 2 +
                3)


################################################################################
# Data types (2)
################################################################################

#
# Strings ("str")
#

# A string is an immutable object consisting of characters. "Immutable" means
# that if you modify a string, you actually create a completely new one and will
# use up memory for both strings.
a_string = "I am a string"

# Strings can be created using double quotes, single quotes, three double
# quotes, or three single quotes. The outer quote is always the relevant one.
a_string = "I am a string"
a_string = 'I am also a string'
a_string = 'You can use the other quotes " inside a string'
a_string = "... and the other way around: ' "
a_string = "Line one.\nLine 2.\nLine 3."  # "\n" is the newline character

# 3 quotes may include linebreaks (adds newline character "\n" automatically)
a_string = """I am a string...
and I include a linebreak
as I span multiple lines."""

# You can escape effects of quotes by using the escape character backslash "\"
a_string = 'I want to use " and \' in a string without ending it.'

# If you want to use backslashes in strings, you have to escape their own escape
# function, i.e., use a double backslash:
windows_path = "C:\\Windows\\System32"

# Alternatively, you can use a "raw" string by putting an "r" in front of the
# first quote to ignore the special meaning of characters:
windows_path = r"C:\Windows\System32"
# Note: If a backslash "\" is used as last character of a raw string, it has an
# additional special meaning and will escape the last quote character that
# would end the string. r"C:\Windows\System32\"" would be equivalent to
# r'C:\Windows\System32"'. If you want to use a "\" as last character, you will
# have to escape the special meaning, even in raw strings: r"C:\Windows\\".

#
# There are multiple convenience operations on strings:
#

# Concatenation
conc_strings = "I am " + "3 concatenated" + ' strings!'
conc_strings += " Plus one more!"
automatic_concatenation = "This will result in a single string as " \
                          "if it were " "manually concatenated"

# Case transformation (here, we actually used an advanced concept called
# methods, which we will learn later)
uppercase_string = conc_strings.upper()
lowercase_string = "SILENCE!".lower()

# Repetition
repeated_string = "bla" * 3

# This will not work but try it and try to understand the error message:
# not_possible = "bla" / 3

# Length (the used concept here is a function, which we will learn later)
string_length = len(conc_strings)

# Getting the i-th character of a string via "some_string[i]", where the index
# "i" must be in the range [0, len(some_string)). We will learn more about
# indexing later.
some_string = "hello"
char = some_string[0]  # Character at index 0 = first character = "h"
# However, since strings are immutable, assignment is not possible:
# some_string[0] = "a"

# Counting substrings
number_of_bla = repeated_string.count("bla")

# Splitting or joining strings (from and to so-called lists, which we will learn
# later, again in combination with methods)
separated_elements = "my-string-elements".split("-")
joined_elements = ";".join(separated_elements)

# Replacing and finding substrings (keep in mind that this creates a
# completely new string in the background! again: methods are used here)
replacement = "This is a placeholder".replace("placeholder", "string")
check_for_substring = "string" in conc_strings
locate_substring = replacement.find("is a")

# More common string methods:
# http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

# You can include all kinds of objects in strings with f"{variable_name}" using
# formatted strings. Formatted strings start with an "f" character
a = 1
b = 2.2
c = a + b
string = f"We calculated c = a + b = {a} + {b} = {c}"

# There are many types of formatting options available, like
long_number = 100 / 3
formatted_string = "You can format floating point values as :width.precision " \
                   f"{long_number:10.5f}"
# You can even use variables, or expressions in general, in the options:
n_decimals = 3
another_formatted_string = f"{long_number:.{n_decimals}f}"

# For more information on string formatting and the available options, see
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings

# Strings can be indexed and sliced like lists, which we learn later.

#
# None
#

# None is the sole value of the data type "NoneType" in Python. It typically
# represents the absence of a value. This will play a role later, when, e.g., a
# function does not return anything.
a = None


################################################################################
# Data type conversions
################################################################################

# If you want to convert an object to another data type, be careful since you
# might lose information! You can convert to data types like this:
val = 2.9
# Conversion of "val" to float (it actually already was a float here):
as_float = float(val)
# Conversion of "val" to int. Note how we lose the information after the
# floating point (it is not rounded to the nearest integer!):
as_int = int(val)
# Conversion of "val" to bool. 0 translates to False, everything else to True:
as_bool = bool(val)
# Conversion of "val" to str. Python will do its best to convert meaningfully:
as_string = str(val)
# NoneType cannot be converted to int or float, but can be "converted" to str:
# not_possible = int(None)
none_string = str(None)


################################################################################
# Details on evaluation order
################################################################################

# Multiple assignments in one line are possible. Assignments are performed from
# right to left. The following line will create "var3" with content 8, then
# "var2" with content of "var3" and then "var1" with content of "var2":
var1 = var2 = var3 = 2 * 4


################################################################################
# Console input and output
################################################################################

# The console is the primary and default input and output device. To create an
# output, we make use of the built-in function "print", which will print the
# specified object in its string representation to the console. Per default, a
# newline character "\n" is automatically added at the end.
print("Hello, world!")  # This is already a string
print(123.456)  # Converts the float via "str" (see data type conversion above)

# Multiple objects can also be passed to "print", which will then be printed in
# sequential order, separated by a whitespace:
print("this", "will", "be", "separated", "by", 1, "whitespace")

# User input from the console can be retrieved with the function "input", which
# will read the input as string, i.e., appropriate data type conversion must be
# done manually afterwards.
my_input = input("Please enter something: ")  # "my_input" will be a string
# Here, we again use a Python built-in called "type" that returns the data type
# of the object we passed (you can ignore the "__name__")
print(f"data type of 'my_input': {type(my_input).__name__}")
