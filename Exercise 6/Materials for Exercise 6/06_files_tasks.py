# Task 1
#

# Create a File "my_file.txt" and write some text to it. Then, open it again and
# append some text. Finally, open it only to read all the content and print it
# to the console. Use "with" blocks to open the files.

with open("my_file.txt", "a", encoding = "utf-8") as f:

#
# Task 2
#

# Use the "glob" module to print a list of all files ending in ".txt" in the
# current working directory and all subdirectories. Also use the "os" module
# when joining paths.

glob.glob("**" "*.txt" recursive = True)

#
# Task 3
#

# Write a function that can write 2D nested lists/matrices (parameter 1) to a
# CSV file (parameter 2). As delimiter (parameter 3), a comma should be used by
# default. Optionally, matrix column names can be specified (parameter 4), which
# must then also be written to the CSV file as the first row. The character
# encoding should be hard-coded as UTF-8. You do not have to perform any error
# checking in this task like checking if the number of column names matches the
# number of columns in the specified matrix.

# Task 4
#

# Write a function that can read CSV files (parameter 1) as produced by task 3
# (see above) and returns the data as a 2D nested list. The list elements can
# stay strings, i.e., no data type conversion is needed. A boolean flag should
# indicate whether the file contains column names in the first row, which should
# be False by default (parameter 2). If True, the column names (as list) should
# be returned in addition to the 2D nested list, i.e., a 2-tuple should be
# returned. The encoding should be UTF-8 by default (parameter 3).
