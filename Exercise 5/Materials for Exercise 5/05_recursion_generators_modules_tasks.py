#
# Task 1
#

# Write a function with a variable number of integer arguments that specify the
# shape of a multidimensional int matrix (use nested lists as implementation).
# For instance, if the user calls "matrix(2, 3)", a nested list is returned,
# where the outer list has 2 inner lists, and each inner list has 3 ints. By
# default, 0 should be used as int values, but the user can specify a different
# fill value via an optional parameter. Use recursion to solve this task.

#matrix(2,3,4,3,2)
#matrix(2,3) --> [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
#matrix (4) --> [0,0,0,0]
#matrix() --> []
def matrix(*args,fill_value=0):
    if len(args):    #base case 1
        return []
    if len(args) == 1    #base case 2
        return [fill_value] * args[0]
    #recursive call
    n_lists = args[0]
    for i in range (n_lists):
        new_list.appen(matrix(*args[1:], fill_value=fill_value))
        return new_list

#
# Task 2
#

# Write a function that takes an arbitrary number of positional arguments as
# input. You can assume these arguments are either strings or nested lists of
# strings. Create a flat (=not nested) list from these arguments that holds only
# the strings. Use the built-in function "isinstance(a, list)" to check if some
# object "a" is of type "list". Use recursion to solve this task.
some_list = ["file2.txt", "file3.txt"]
some_nested_list = ["file4.png", "file5.txt", ["file6.txt", "file7.dat"]]
# Example function call:
# my_function("file0.txt", "file1.png", some_list, some_nested_list)

def my_function(*args)   args:
    result = []
    for arg in args:
        if isinstance(arg, str):
            result.append(arg)
        elif isinstance(arg, list):
            result.extend(my_function(arg))
    return result




#
# Task 3
#

# Write a generator function "next_element(my_sequence)" that yields the next
# element in "my_sequence". If the sequence is exhausted (i.e., if the last
# element has been reached), the next element should be the first element again.
# Write a loop that calls "next_element" 25 times and prints the currently
# returned value. Example function call:
# next_element("abcdefg")

def next_element(my_sequence)
    i = 0
    while True:
        yield my_sequence [i % len(my_sequence)]
        i += 1
gen = next_element....


#
# Task 4
#

# Write a generator function "next_element(my_sequence, max_iter)" that yields
# the next element in "my_sequence". If the sequence is exhausted (i.e., if the
# last element has been reached), the next element should be the first element
# again. Only a maximum of "max_iter" elements should be returned. Write a loop
# that calls "next_element" until some specified "max_iter" is reached and
# prints the currently returned value. Example function call:
# next_element("abcdefg", max_iter=20)

# Your code here #
# we skipped this

#
# Task 5
#

# Write a generator function that takes an iterable of any type as input and
# yields 2-tuples where the first tuple entry is the number of the current loop
# iteration and the second entry is the current loop element. Do not use the
# existing function "enumerate".

# "abc" ------> (i, elem) ---> (0,"a")   (1,"b")   (2, "c")

def my_enumarate(iterable):
    #for i in range(len(iterable)):
    #   yield i, iterable[i]
    i = 0
    for elem in iterable:
        yield i, elem
        i += 1
